  <h1>The Depth of the Ocean</h1>
  <h2>San Francisco is as wide as the ocean is deep.</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>San Francisco</strong> is about 6.8 miles, or <strong>35,904 ft</strong> across, from the Ferry Building to Ocean Beach .
    <br>
    <strong>The deepest part of the ocean</strong> is 10,935 meters (<strong>35,876 ft</strong>) below sea level (Challenger Deep). 
    <br>
    <br>
    That means you can <strong>walk the depth of the ocean across San Francisco.</strong>
  </p>

    <h2>If the Ferry Building was the surface of the ocean ... </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The average depth of the San Francisco Bay is only 4m (13ft). From the Ferry Building, you wouldn't even reach the Embarcadero.</li>
        <li>The average depth of the Great Barrier Reef would sit between the North-bound and South-bound Embarcadero streets.</li>
        <li>The shore of the dead sea would sit at around the Embarcadero Bart Station.</li>
        <li>Light from the surface wouldn't reach past the Montgomery Bart Station.</li>
        <li>Elephant Seals could dive all the way to 7th St.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>So how do I take this tour?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Start at the Ferry Building. This is our "Surface of the Ocean"!</li>
    <li>The first third of your journey is straight down Market Street. This is where most of the known ocean is!</li>
    <li>At 10th St, you'll take a right onto Fell. Follow Fell across the Panhandle into Golden Gate Park.</li>
    <li>If you want to reach the full ocean depths, wander your way through Golden Gate Park from East to West until you reach the beach.</li>
    <li>Ocean Beach is Challenger Deep, the deepest known point of the ocean. Congrats, you made it!</li>
  </ol>
